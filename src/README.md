# Documentation

Welcome to the Normcore documentation site!

If you're new to Normcore, we recommend starting with the [Getting Started](./getting-started) guide. It's a great place to get familiar with setting up a Normcore in a fresh project.

We're always working to improve Normcore as much as we can. If you have any questions or feedback, [hop over to our Discord](https://normcore.io/discord) and let us know.
